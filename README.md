Hello im semir metjahic and this is my project on player stats. I have combined alot of differnt types of data such as points per game, rebounds, field goal percenatges etc. I made a way as to where all of the data gets combined into one and you can see it on a mini sclae/graph. You can see all of the players in boxes and shows all of there averaged stats and that goes for all the players. its an easy way to see how each player is doing and u can also use this towards ur fantasy basketball to see which players you may want. Thank you and i hope you enjoy!
